# Mechanical-Puzzles



Here is some work on mechanical puzzles that I've done. Currently, we have two files in this repo

Rubik's cube, a working Rubik's cube object that rotates as a real cube does. Solution algorithm to come.

Grecian computer (github version), an interesting puzzle based on spinning wooden wheels to make a common sum. Pictures were originally included in the original Jupyter notebook, but github had issues with that so I seperated two images out (a picture of the puzzle and a picture of the solution) and deleted some others that I used in the original notebook.
